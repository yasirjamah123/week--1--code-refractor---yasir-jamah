## description
MyProject is a web-based task management application that allows users to create, organize, and manage their tasks efficiently. The motivation behind this project was to streamline task management for individuals and teams, providing a user-friendly interface to help users keep track of their tasks, deadlines, and priorities.

## Key Features:
Create tasks with titles, descriptions, due dates, and priority levels.
Organize tasks into customizable categories or projects.
Mark tasks as completed and archive them for reference.
User-friendly dashboard with an overview of upcoming tasks and deadlines.
MyProject was built to address the problem of disorganized task management and the need for a centralized platform to keep track of tasks, making it easier for users to stay organized and productive. Through the development of this project, I learned valuable skills in web development, including front-end and back-end technologies, database management, and user interface design.
